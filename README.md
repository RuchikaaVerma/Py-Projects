🐢 Turtle Crossing Game
Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This project is a simple, classic arcade-style game where a turtle must cross a busy highway without getting hit by cars. It's a fun way to learn about object-oriented programming and game development in Python.

🎮 How to Play
The objective is simple: help the turtle cross the road! The game gets harder as you level up, with the cars moving faster and faster.

Press the Up key to move the turtle forward.

Avoid the randomly generated cars that move across the screen.

Cross to the top of the screen to level up. The turtle will be reset to the start, and the cars will get faster.

If a car hits the turtle, it's Game Over.

🛠️ Technology Used
This project was built using Python and a few powerful libraries.

Python: The core programming language used for all game logic.

Pygame: A robust library for creating 2D games, handling graphics, sprites, and user input. This was a key upgrade from the simpler Turtle library, allowing for real images and better performance.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
This project is more than just a game; it's a practical exercise in key programming concepts. By building this game, you will have learned:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): How to structure a project using classes like Player, Car, and Scoreboard to manage different aspects of the game.

Game Loop: The fundamental structure of every game, which continuously handles input, updates game state, and renders graphics.

Collision Detection: The logic behind checking if two objects (the turtle and a car) have made contact.

Sprite Management: How to use the Pygame library to load and manipulate images (.png files) as game objects, including handling transparency with .convert_alpha().

UI/UX Fundamentals: Creating an interactive user interface with a clear scoreboard and a game over screen.

Enjoy the project, and happy coding! 🚀
