🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This project is a simple, classic arcade-style game where a turtle must cross a busy highway without getting hit by cars. It's a fun way to learn about object-oriented programming and game development in Python.

🎮 How to Play
The objective is simple: help the turtle cross the road! The game gets harder as you level up, with the cars moving faster and faster.

⬆️ A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.

🚗 Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.

🏁 When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.

💥 When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.

🛠️ Technology Used
This project was built using Python and a few powerful libraries.

Python: The core programming language used for all game logic.

Pygame: A robust library for creating 2D games, handling graphics, sprites, and user input. This was a key upgrade from the simpler Turtle library, allowing for real images and better performance.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
This project is more than just a game; it's a practical exercise in key programming concepts. By building this game, you will have learned:

💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): How to structure a project using classes like Player, Car, and Scoreboard to manage different aspects of the game.

🔄 Game Loop: The fundamental structure of every game, which continuously handles input, updates game state, and renders graphics.

🚧 Collision Detection: The logic behind checking if two objects (the turtle and a car) have made contact.

🖼️ Sprite Management: How to use the Pygame library to load and manipulate images (.png files) as game objects, including handling transparency with .convert_alpha().

📈 UI/UX Fundamentals: Creating an interactive user interface with a clear scoreboard and a game over screen.

Enjoy the project, and happy coding! 🚀
